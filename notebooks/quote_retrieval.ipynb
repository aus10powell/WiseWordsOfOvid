and no deviation has been made from it, except in a few\\ninstances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;\\nat the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been\\ncarefully consulted.', 'The several editions vary materially in respect to\\npunctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in\\nadopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each\\npassage the intended meaning of the writer.\\n\\n', 'The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the\\nEnglish language.', 'On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the\\nGreek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole\\nof the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five\\ntranslations in Verse are there enumerated.', 'A prose version of the\\nMetamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson, about the middle of\\nthe last century, which professes to be “as near the original as the\\ndifferent idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be\\n“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”', 'A few\\nmoments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it has not\\nthe slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation, while,\\nby its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has gained\\nnothing in elegance of diction.', 'It is accompanied by “critical,\\nhistorical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best\\nCommentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,\\nentirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations\\nwill be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the\\nearly part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities\\nof the text.', 'A fifth edition of this translation was published so\\nrecently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up\\nof the old-fashioned language of the original preface.', 'A far more\\nliteral translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which\\nwas first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh\\nedition in 1779.', 'Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to\\nfulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as\\npossible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the\\nfact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early\\npart of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at\\nexplanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the\\nrequirements of the present age.', 'Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too\\nmuch to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,\\n“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of\\nregaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in\\nmany instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author.', 'Some of\\nthe curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;\\nbut, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion, a\\nfew of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered “neat,”\\nwhether applied to a fish, a cow, a chariot, a laurel, the steps of a\\ntemple, or the art of wrestling.', 'He renders “horridus,” “in a rude\\npickle;” “virgo” is generally translated “the young lady;” “vir” is\\n“a gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are indifferently “the old blade,”\\n“the old fellow,” or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very\\ntip-top.”', '“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;”\\n“pellex” is “a miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is\\n“to scower off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and\\n“squalidus” is “in a sorry pickle.”', '“Importuna” is “a plaguy baggage;”\\n“adulterium” is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes either “a long\\nrabble of words,” “a long-winded detail,” or “a tale of a tub;”\\n“miserabile carmen” is “a dismal ditty;” “increpare hos” is “to rattle\\nthese blades;” “penetralia” means “the parlour;” while “accingere,” more\\nliterally than elegantly, is translated “buckle to.”', '“Situs” is “nasty\\nstuff;” “oscula jungere” is “to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a\\ncircumlocution for “a blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old\\nwoman’s accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the\\nsense of the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the\\nother glass.”', 'These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure\\nthe most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.\\n\\n', 'In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn] B[ulloker,]\\nentitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically, and, according\\nto the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar and the verse\\nwill bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be used according\\nto the directions in the preface to the painfull schoolmaster, and more\\nfully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or the Grammar school,\\nchap.', '8.’”', 'Notwithstanding a title so pretentious, it contains a\\ntranslation of no more than the first 567 lines of the first Book,\\nexecuted in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity is now the\\nonly merit of the volume.', 'A literal interlinear translation of the first\\nBook “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,” was published in 1839,\\nwhich had been already preceded by “a selection from the Metamorphoses\\nof Ovid, adapted to the Hamiltonian system, by a literal and interlineal\\ntranslation,” published by James Hamilton, the author of the Hamiltonian\\nsystem.', 'This work contains selections only from the first six books, and\\nconsequently embraces but a very small portion of the entire work.\\n\\n', 'For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and\\nallusions, explanations have been added, which are principally derived\\nfrom the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus, Pausanias, Dio Cassius,\\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus, Nonnus, and others of the\\nhistorians, philosophers, and mythologists of antiquity.', 'A great number\\nof these illustrations are collected in the elaborate edition of Ovid,\\npublished by the Abbé Banier, one of the most learned scholars of the\\nlast century; who has, therein, and in his “Explanations of the Fables\\nof Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and research, culled from the\\nworks of ancient authors, all such information as he considered likely\\nto throw any light upon the Mythology and history of Greece and Rome.\\n\\n', 'This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a statement\\nof the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most likely to\\nenable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various subjects\\npresented to his notice.', 'Indeed, except in two or three instances, space\\nhas been found too limited to allow of more than an occasional reference\\nto the opinions of modern scholars.', 'Such being the object of the\\nexplanations, the reader will not be surprised at the absence of\\ncritical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot points of\\nMythology and early history which have occupied, with no very positive\\nresult, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and many\\nother scholars of profound learning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ', 'A SYNOPTICAL VIEW\\n  of the Principal Transformations Mentioned in\\n  THE METAMORPHOSES.\\n\\n  ', '[From Bell edition, omitting Books VIII-XV.]\\n\\n\\nBOOK I.\\n\\nChaos is divided by the Deity into four Elements: to these their\\nrespective inhabitants are assigned, and man is created from earth and\\nwater.', 'The four Ages follow, and in the last of these the Giants aspire\\nto the sovereignty of the heavens; being slain by Jupiter, a new race of\\nmen springs up from their blood.', 'These becoming noted for their impiety,\\nJupiter not only transforms Lycaon into a wolf, but destroys the whole\\nrace of men and animals by a Deluge, with the exception of Deucalion and\\nPyrrha, who, when the waters have abated, renew the human race, by\\nthrowing stones behind them.', 'Other animated beings are produced by heat\\nand moisture: and, among them, the serpent Python.', 'Phœbus slays him, and\\ninstitutes the Pythian games as a memorial of the event, in which the\\nconquerors are crowned with beech;

but Inachus is not there, as he is\\ngrieving for his daughter Io, whom Jupiter, having first ravished her,\\nhas changed into a cow.', 'She is entrusted by Juno to the care of Argus;\\nMercury having first related to him the transformation of the Nymph\\nSyrinx into reeds, slays him, on which his eyes are placed by Juno in\\nthe tail of the peacock.', 'Io, having recovered human shape, becomes the\\nmother of Epaphus.\\n\\n\\nBOOK II.\\n\\nEpaphus, having accused Phaëton of falsely asserting that Phœbus is his\\nfather, Phaëton requests Phœbus, as a proof of his affection towards his\\nchild, to allow him the guidance of the chariot of the Sun for one day.\\n', 'This being granted, the whole earth is set on fire by him, and the\\nÆthiopians are turned black by the heat.', 'Jupiter strikes Phaëton with a\\nthunderbolt, and while his sisters and his kinsman Cyenus are lamenting\\nhim, the former are changed into trees, and Cyenus into a swan.', 'On\\nvisiting the earth, that he may repair the damage caused by the\\nconflagration, Jupiter sees Calisto, and, assuming the form of Diana, he\\ndebauches her.', 'Juno, being enraged, changes Calisto into a bear;

and, as in those\\n  languages the same word signifies either a ship or a horse, those who\\n  afterwards interpreted the fable, took the word in the latter\\n  signification, and spoke of a horse instead of a ship, which was\\n  really the original emblem employed in the fiction.\\n\\n  ', 'Vossius thinks that the fable originated in a dispute between the\\n  sailors of Athens, who acknowledged Neptune for their chief, and the\\n  people, who followed the Senate, governed by Minerva.', 'The people\\n  prevailed, and a life of civilization, marked by attention to the\\n  pursuits of agriculture, was substituted for one of piracy;

retreat in the court of Æetes, his\\n  kinsman.', 'Helle died on the voyage, but Phryxus arrived in Colchis,\\n  where he dedicated the prow of his ship to Neptune, or Jupiter.', 'He\\n  there married

Athamas, were shipwrecked on an island, where they remained until\\n  found there by Jason, who took them back to their mother.', 'Having\\n  mourned them as dead, she was transported with joy on finding them,\\n  and used every exertion to aid Jason in promoting his addresses to\\n  Medea.', 'Æetes having seized the treasures of Athamas on the death of\\n  Phryxus, the Greeks prepared an expedition to recover them, and to\\n  avenge his death.', 'Pelias, who had driven his brother Æson from the\\n  throne of Iolcos, desiring to procure the absence of his son Jason,\\n  took this

ship was so named from its swiftness;\\n  while others say, that it was so called from Argus, the name of its\\n  builder, or from the Argives, or Greeks, on board of it.', 'Bochart,\\n  however, supposes, that the name is derived from the Phœnician word\\n  ‘arco,’ which signifies ‘long,’ and suggests, that before that time\\n  the Greeks sailed in vessels of a rounder form, Jason being the first\\n  who sailed in a ship built in the form of a galley.', 'After many\\n  adventures, on arriving at the Isle of Lemnos, they found that the\\n  women had killed their husbands in a fit of

form, with crooked beaks and talons, huge wings, and the faces\\n  of women, the Argonauts, and especially Calais and Zethes, pursued as\\n  far as the islands called Strophades, in the Ionian sea, where Iris\\n  appearing to them, enjoined them to pursue the Harpies no further,\\n  promising that Phineus should no longer be persecuted by them.', 'To\\n  explain this story, some suppose that the Harpies were the daughters\\n  of Phineus, who by their dissipation and extravagance, had ruined him\\n  in his old age, which occasioned the saying, that they snatched the\\n  victuals out of his mouth.', 'Le Clerc thinks, that the Harpies were vast\\n  swarms of grasshoppers, which ravaged all Paphlagonia, and caused a\\n  famine in the dominions of Phineus; the word ‘arbati,’ whence the term\\n  ‘Harpy’ is derived, signifying ‘a grasshopper;’ and that the North\\n  wind blowing them into the Ionian sea, it gave rise to the saying,\\n  that the sons of Boreas pursued them so far.', 'Diodorus Siculus does not\\n  mention the Harpies, though he speaks of the arrival of the Argonauts\\n  at the court of Phineus.\\n\\n  ', 'After some other adventures, the Argonauts arrived at

the Mythological\\nnarratives of ancient Greece and Rome, so ingeniously framed, as to\\nembrace a large amount of information upon almost every subject\\nconnected with the learning, traditions, manners, and customs of\\nantiquity, and have afforded a fertile field of investigation to the\\nlearned of the civilized world.', 'To present to the public a faithful\\ntranslation of a work, universally esteemed, not only for its varied\\ninformation, but as being the masterpiece of one of the greatest Poets\\nof ancient Rome, is the object of the present volume.\\n\\n', 'To render the work, which, from its nature and design, must, of\\nnecessity, be replete with matter of obscure meaning, more inviting to\\nthe scholar, and more intelligible to those who are unversed in\\nClassical literature, the translation is accompanied with Notes and\\nExplanations, which, it is believed, will be found to throw considerable\\nlight upon the origin and meaning of some of the traditions of heathen\\nMythology.\\n\\n', 'In the translation, the text of the Delphin edition has been generally\\nadopted; and no deviation has been made from it, except in a few\\ninstances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;\\nat the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been\\ncarefully consulted.', 'The several editions vary materially in respect to\\npunctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in\\nadopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each\\npassage the intended meaning of the writer.\\n\\n', 'The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the\\nEnglish language.', 'On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the\\nGreek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole\\nof the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five\\ntranslations in Verse are there enumerated.', 'A\\xa0prose version of the\\nMetamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson, about the middle of\\nthe last century, which professes to be “as near the original as the\\ndifferent idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be\\n“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”', 'A\\xa0few\\nmoments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it has not\\nthe slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation, while,\\nby its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has gained\\nnothing in elegance of diction.', 'It is accompanied by “critical,\\nhistorical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best\\nCommentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,\\nentirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations\\nwill be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the\\nearly part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities\\nof the text.', 'A\\xa0fifth edition of this translation was published so\\nrecently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up\\nof the old-fashioned language of the original preface.', 'A\\xa0far more\\nliteral translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which\\nwas first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh\\nedition in 1779.', 'Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to\\nfulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as\\npossible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the\\nfact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early\\npart of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at\\nexplanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the\\nrequirements of the present age.', 'Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too\\nmuch to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,\\n“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of\\nregaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in\\nmany instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author.', 'Some of\\nthe curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;\\nbut, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion,\\na\\xa0few of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered “neat,”\\nwhether applied to a fish, a\\xa0cow, a\\xa0chariot, a\\xa0laurel, the steps of a\\ntemple, or the art of wrestling.', 'He renders “horridus,” “in a rude\\npickle;” “virgo” is generally translated “the young lady;” “vir” is\\n“a\\xa0gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are indifferently “the old blade,”\\n“the old fellow,” or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very\\ntip-top.”', '“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;”\\n“pellex” is “a\\xa0miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is\\n“to scower off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and\\n“squalidus” is “in a sorry pickle.”', '“Importuna” is “a\\xa0plaguy baggage;”\\n“adulterium” is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes either “a\\xa0long\\nrabble of words,” “a\\xa0long-winded detail,” or “a\\xa0tale of a tub;”\\n“miserabile carmen” is “a\\xa0dismal ditty;” “increpare hos” is “to rattle\\nthese blades;” “penetralia” means “the parlour;” while “accingere,” more\\nliterally than elegantly, is translated “buckle to.”', '“Situs” is “nasty\\nstuff;” “oscula jungere” is “to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a\\ncircumlocution for “a\\xa0blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old\\nwoman’s accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the\\nsense of the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the\\nother glass.”', 'These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure\\nthe most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.\\n\\n  ', '[Transcriber’s Note:\\n\\n  The Clarke “translation” was published as part of a student edition\\n  of Ovid’s _', 'Metamorphoses_, with the Latin on the top half of the page,\\n  the English below.', 'It was not intended as an independent text.]\\n\\n', 'In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn] B[ulloker,]\\nentitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically, and, according\\nto the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar and the verse\\nwill bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be used according\\nto the directions in the preface to the painfull schoolmaster, and more\\nfully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or the Grammar school,\\nchap.', '8.’”', 'Notwithstanding a title so pretentious, it contains a\\ntranslation of no more than the first 567 lines of the first Book,\\nexecuted in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity is now the\\nonly merit of the volume.', 'A\\xa0literal interlinear translation of the first\\nBook “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,” was published in 1839,\\nwhich had been already preceded by “a\\xa0selection from the Metamorphoses\\nof Ovid, adapted to the Hamiltonian system, by a literal and interlineal\\ntranslation,” published by James Hamilton, the author of the Hamiltonian\\nsystem.', 'This work contains selections only from the first six books, and\\nconsequently embraces but a very small portion of the entire work.\\n\\n', 'For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and\\nallusions, explanations have been added, which are principally derived\\nfrom the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus, Pausanias, Dio Cassius,\\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus, Nonnus, and others of the\\nhistorians, philosophers, and mythologists of antiquity.', 'A\\xa0great number\\nof these illustrations are collected in the elaborate edition of Ovid,\\npublished by the Abbé Banier, one of the most learned scholars of the\\nlast century; who has, therein, and in his “Explanations of the Fables\\nof Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and research, culled from the\\nworks of ancient authors, all such information as he considered likely\\nto throw any light upon the Mythology and history of Greece and Rome.\\n\\n', 'This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a statement\\nof the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most likely to\\nenable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various subjects\\npresented to his notice.', 'Indeed, except in two or three instances, space\\nhas been found too limited to allow of more than an occasional reference\\nto the opinions of modern scholars.', 'Such being the object of the\\nexplanations, the reader will not be surprised at the absence of\\ncritical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot points of\\nMythology and early history which have occupied, with no very positive\\nresult, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and many\\nother scholars of profound learning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'A SYNOPTICAL

said, then, that Hercules at length overcame this bull, and\\n  broke off one of his horns; by which was meant, according to Strabo,\\n  that he brought both the branches of the river into one

at a cow, which happened to stray from the herd, unfortunately\\n  killed him.', 'This accidental homicide lost him the kingdom of Mycenæ,\\n  which was to have formed the dower of Alcmena.',

master of his brother’s\\n  dominions, which he left, at his death, to his son Eurystheus, the\\n  inveterate persecutor of Hercules.\\n\\n  ', 'Amphitryon, obliged to retire to Thebes, was there absolved by\\n  Creon; but when, as he thought, he was about to receive the hand of\\n  Alcmena, who accompanied him to the court of that prince, she\\n  declared that, not being satisfied with the revenge which her father\\n  had taken on the Teleboans, she would consent to be the prize of him\\n  who would undertake to declare war against them.', 'Amphitryon accepted\\n  these conditions, and,

ally, Cephalus.\\n\\n  ', 'It was during this war that Hercules came into the world; and\\n  whether Amphitryon had secretly consummated his marriage before his\\n  departure, or whether he had returned privately to Thebes, or to\\n  Tirynthus, where Hercules was said to have been born, it was\\n  published, that Jupiter, to deceive Alcmena, had taken the form of\\n  her husband, and was the father of the infant Hercules.', 'If this is\\n  not the true explanation of the story, it may have been invented to\\n  conceal some intrigue in which Alcmena was detected; or, in process\\n  of time, to account for the extraordinary strength and valour of\\n  Hercules, it may have been said that Jupiter, and not Amphitryon,\\n  was the father of Hercules.', 'Indeed, we find Seneca, in one of his\\n  Tragedies, putting these words into the mouth of Hercules:--\\n  ‘Whether all that has been said upon this subject be held as\\n  undoubted truth, or whether it proves to be but a fable, and that my\\n  father was, after all, in reality, but a mortal; my mother’s fault\\n  is sufficiently effaced by my valour, and I have merit sufficient to\\n  have had Jupiter for my father.’', 'The more readily, perhaps, to\\n  account for the transcendent strength and prowess of Hercules, the\\n  story was invented, that Jupiter made the night on which he was\\n  received by Alcmena under the form of Amphitryon, as long as three,\\n  or, according to Plautus, Hyginus, and Seneca, nine nights.', 'Some\\n  writers say that Alcmena brought forth twins, one of which,\\n  Iphiclus, was the son of
