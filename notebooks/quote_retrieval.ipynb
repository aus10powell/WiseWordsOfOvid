Capitalization style: The capitalization style in the given text is standard and does not deviate from what is seen in the reference quotes.\\n3. Acronyms and abbreviations: There are no acronyms or unusual abbreviations in the given text.\\n4. Writing style: The writing style in the given text is concise and impactful which aligns with Ovid\\'s style of writing.\\n5.
